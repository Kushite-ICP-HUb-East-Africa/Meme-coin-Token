## MemeToken

## Overview
MemeToken is a fun and engaging token designed to embody the spirit of internet memes while providing robust functionality. This project includes implementations in multiple languages and platforms, including TypeScript, Motoko, Rust, and Solidity. MemeToken incorporates essential features to ensure a comprehensive and secure token ecosystem.

## Features
1. Minting and Burning
    Minting: Create new tokens to increase the total supply.
    Burning: Destroy existing tokens to reduce the total supply.

2. Transfers and Transactions
    Transfers: Send tokens between accounts securely.
    Transactions: Handle token transactions with detailed logging and events.

3. Token Metadata
    Metadata: Store and retrieve token details such as name, symbol, and total supply.

4. Pausing and Unpausing Transfers
    Control Liquidity: Pause and unpause token transfers to manage liquidity effectively.

5. Security and Access Control
    Access Control: Ensure secure access and permissions for sensitive token functions like minting and pausing.

6. Token Locking and Vesting
    Locking: Lock tokens for a specific period.
    Vesting: Implement vesting schedules for gradual token release.

7. Voting and Governance
    Governance: Allow token holders to participate in voting and decision-making processes.

8. Token Rewards and Incentives
    Rewards: Implement reward mechanisms for token holders' participation and contributions.

9. Token Swaps and Exchanges
    Swaps: Facilitate token swaps and interactions with decentralized exchanges.

10. Token Staking and Yield Farming
    Staking: Enable token holders to stake their tokens.
    Yield Farming: Participate in yield farming activities to earn additional rewards.
